## Dataset

> The dataset used in this project is from the Ford GoBike Systems. It includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It was downloaded from https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1658636184635630&usg=AOvVaw0Fn2YpzrZcI5oebAceMdc7


## Summary of Findings

> * Most of the members in this dataset are of ages between 25-35 years old, the number of trips gradually decreases as the age increases. 90.53% of the trips were taken by subscriber type, whereas 9.47% were taken by the customer type. The majority of members were Male and there are 9.90% of members who share the bike for all trips.

> * Compared to the subscribers, the customers have higher trip duration. It seems like the customer will rent the bike and use it instantaneously for fun or entertainment related activities. Subcribers on the other hand are are primarily daily commuters, having short trips to and from work/school, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around lunch time 

> * The duration of trips on weekends (Saturday & Sunday) are higher than the trips on the weekdays. Also the average duration of trips for subscriber user type among the week days is the almost the same whereas for customer user type jumped to its highest on the weekends, and the rest of the week day it almost closely similar. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> * For the presentation, I focus on trip duration and trip count. I start by finding the relationship between user characteristics & trip count by presenting different type of visualization (Histogram, Pie Chart & Bar Plot). Then I found the relation between trip duration and user characteristics like (member age & user type).

> * Afterwards, I introduce the different time periods like (the weekdays or the hour of the day) and its relation with the trips duration based on different user characteristics.
